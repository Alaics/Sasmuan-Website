                Santa Lucia, previously known as Poblacion, is a barangay
                located in the municipality of Sasmuan, Pampanga. According to
                the 2020 Census, its population was 3,538, accounting for 12.17%
                of Sasmuan's total population.

                The Santa Lucia Parish Church in Sasmuan is the province's first
                church built by Augustinian priests. It's right next to the RÃ­o
                Grande, an old waterway connecting Pampanga to Manila Bay.
                Constructed by Jose Duque in the 17th century, the church was
                rebuilt in the early 1800s and later reinforced by Toribio
                Fanjul in 1884.

                <p>
                  The "Kuraldal" in St. Lucy, Sasmuan, Pampanga, is a festive
                  religious celebration dedicated to honoring St. Lucy. It
                  typically involves lively processions with music, dance, and
                  community participation. The event serves as a cultural and
                  religious expression, bringing the community together to
                  celebrate their faith and heritage.

                <p>
                  In many places, including the Philippines, St. Lucy's feast
                  day is celebrated with religious processions, prayers, and
                  various cultural events. If Santa Lucia in Sasmuan has a
